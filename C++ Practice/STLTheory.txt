Standard Template Library(STL):-
        • It is a Library of Generic Classes and functions.

Why use STL:- 
        Reuse - well tested components.
        Time saving.
        STL is used because its a good idea not to Reinvent the wheel.

Components of STL:- 
        1) Containers  - Object which Stores data.
                       - Use Template Classes
        2) Algorithems - Procedure to process data.
                       - Sorting
                       - Searching
                       - Use TEmplate functions
        3) Iterations  - Object which points to an element of a Container.
                       - Handled just like poiters
                       - Connects algorithems with containers.
                       - Iterator moves as instructed by the algorithems.

Containers :- 
        1) Sequence Containers
                • Linear Fasion - (1)->(2)->(3)->(4)
                    :- Vector
                    :- List
                    :- Dequeue
        2) Associative Containers
                • Direct Access (Tree)
                    :- Set
                    :- Multiset
                    :- Map
                    :- Multimap
        3) Derived Containers
                • Real World Modeling
                    :- Stack
                    :- Queue
                    :- Priority-queue

1) Sequence Containers
    1> Vector :- Random Access --> Fast
                 Insertion/Delection In Middle --> Slow
                 Insertion/Delection at the End --> Fast

    2> List :- Random Access --> Slow
               Insertion/Delection In Middle --> Fast
               Insertion/Delection at the End --> Fast

2) Associative Containers
    • All operations are Fast. (Except Random access)

3) Derived Containers
    • Depends on Data Structure.
