♠ Befor c++ Smalltalk, Ada, Simula 67, Turbo Pascal
♠ First Name - C with classes.
♠ There are 60 Keywords.

//Write a simple output program. 

// #include<iostream>
// using namespace std;
// int main(){
// 	int a,b,c;
// 	cout << "Enter value of a and b = ";
// 	cin >> a >> b;
// 	c = a + b;
// 	cout << "\n c = " <<c;

♠ INTRODUCTION TO OOP'S CONSEPT
• 1) Procedure Oriented Programming:-

Drawbacks of procedure Orientede Programming
1) Complexity increases when no. of lines increases (50000<) because data are global.
2) Not suitable for real life application.
3) Reusibility is limited.
4) It dose not provide data security.

• 2) Object Oriented programming:-
		C++, JAVA, PHP, Python, DotNET
	Object --> Data
		   --> Method (Function)
• Both the drawbacks are removed in object oriented programming.
• Data are not global because it is accosiated with an object.
• So length of program will not increase.
• because of in real life we first deside the object and then apply the procedure therefore it is suitable for real life applicaion.
• data is seperate but function can be same.

♠ Concept of Object oriented Programming :-
	1) Object
	2) Class
	3) Abstraction
	4) Encapsulation
	5) Polymorphism
	6) Inheritance
	7) Dynamic Binding

1) Object :-
	- object is a variable in oop.
	- Object is a user define variable.
	- It is a main entity of oop.
		Fruit		 	  Mango
	  Data type			 object
	User Define D.T		Variable
	- Behaviour of an object in oop is same as behaviour of an integer variable in oop.
	- Objects are class type variable.

2) Class :-
	- Class is a user define data type.
	- Class is a collection of data and function.
