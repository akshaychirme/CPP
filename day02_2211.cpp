3) Data Abtraction :-
	- Representing only the essential details in the program.
	- Without knowing the background details we work with the object.
	- For Ex :- while buying mobile we look for details like ram, processor, camera, battery, price,etc. We dont 
		look for where the ram is placed inside the mobile body. We dont care which item is placed where by company. So here only essential item are important to us.

4) Data Encapsulation :-
	- Binding of data and function is called as Encapsulation.
	- We treat object as a single entity.
	- If we want to access data we have to access function.
	- For Ex - To use Ram, processor, Camera,etc they need to bind together and form a single entity (Mobile).
	
5) Inheritance :-
	- Inheritance is a process in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of its parent object 
		automatically. In such way, you can reuse, extend or modify the attributes and behaviors which are defined in other class.
	- Parent 	- key pad phone --> calling + multimedia
	  child  	- java phone    --> calling + multimedia + camera + touchscreen
	  sub child - smartphone 	--> calling + multimedia + camera + touchscreen + applications install

6) Polymorphism :- (bahurupiya)
	- Same object taking multiple forms is called as polymorphism.
	- For Ex - While capturing photo from mobile then, mobile is acting as a camera device.
			   While playing songs on mobile then, mobile is acting as a multimedia player.
